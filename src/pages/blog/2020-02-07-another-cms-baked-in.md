Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed[a bill](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/86R/billtext/pdf/HB01325F.pdf#navpanes=0)into law on June 10 that legalizes hemp production and cultivation across the state. Texas’ move to legalize hemp is[one of the many](https://www.cbdsnapshot.com/fda-held-its-first-ever-public-hearing-on-cbd-heres-what-you-need-to-know/)results of the[2018 Farm Bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22Agriculture+Improvement+Act+of+2018%5C%22%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=6), which authorized domestic hemp production.

The U.S. currently relies heavily on imported hemp—the plant is now widely seen as a growth opportunity for American farmers. In 2016, the[Hemp Industries Association](https://www.votehemp.com/press_releases/2016-annual-retail-sales-hemp-products-estimated-688-million/)(HIA) found U.S. retail sales of hemp products to be worth nearly $700 million.

Texas farmers, hemp producers and manufacturers will now have a legal avenue to grow and sell their product—the source of hemp fiber, CBD, and more.

The new process, which will be administered by the Texas Department of Agriculture, will include state licensure for hemp producers, transportation guidelines and sampling, inspection, and testing procedures to ensure all hemp products contain no more than .3 percent THC.
